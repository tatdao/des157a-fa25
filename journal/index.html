        <p>The article <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">Best Practices for Form Design</a> got me thinking more about form design. Whenever I have to fill out a form, either a digital or paper one, I notice there are many fields to be filled out. They often leave me feeling overwhelmed, and I end up quitting before finishing the form. However, I’ve noticed that form design has improved a lot. Instead of one lengthy form, it now comes in different steps, which makes it easier to keep track of the filling process.</p>

        <p>For practice number 5, I could understand why we have to mark required fields even though most of them are required. It might seem redundant, but it is extremely helpful to avoid confusion. Personally, I often check for asterisk-marked fields and make sure they are all filled in. Without the “optional” label, I still understand that a field without an asterisk is optional. Still, whether there are optional labels or not, it’s never redundant for some people who are not accustomed to forms.</p>

        <p>I also face the same issue when encountering inline labels. It’s more confusing than helpful to me. Inline labels disappear right after I type in my input, and then I forget what the field is for. I believe the best practice is to put the label above the field. It does not take up much space as many others think and still makes it clear.</p>

        <p>The website I have interacted with that exemplifies best practices is <a href="https://benefitscal.com/Public/login?lang=en">the BenefitsCal website</a>, which I used when applying for Calfresh. The application process was straightforward. It comes with a total of nine steps that clearly tell users how far they have progressed. It starts with instructions on how to fill it out, explaining that fields marked with “required” are mandatory to complete, while the others are considered optional.</p>
